## Skip Advantages

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Genuinely Native" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Skip apps don't just “look native”, they _are_ native: SwiftUI on iOS and Jetpack Compose on Android. You know the difference, and so do your users.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Feather Weight" icon="cloud-download">
		With _Skip Zero_, your iOS app has no dependencies on any Skip frameworks. And the resulting Android app only requires open source libraries.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Memory Efficient" icon="magnifier">
		With no additional managed runtime, Skip apps are as efficient as they can possibly be on both platforms.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Idyllic IDE" icon="heart">
		Skip's IDE is Xcode, the premier development environment for Swift. For serious Android customization, incorporate Kotlin written directly in Android Studio.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Perfect Integration" icon="star">
		Skip supports thousands of cross-platform modules. It also bridges seamlessly with Kotlin and Compose, so integrating with Android libraries is painless.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Foundationally Open" icon="github">
		Swift-on-Android is only half the story. Skip's app development frameworks are all free and open-source.
