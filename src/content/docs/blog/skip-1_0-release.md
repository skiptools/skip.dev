We’re thrilled to announce the release of Skip 1.0!

Skip brings Swift app development to Android. Share Swift business logic, or write entire cross-platform apps in SwiftUI. 

Skip is the only tool that enables you to develop genuinely native apps for **both** major mobile platforms with a single codebase. Under the hood, it uses the vendor-recommended technologies on each OS: Swift and SwiftUI on iOS, Kotlin and Compose on Android. So your apps don’t just “look native”, they *are* native, with no additional resource-hogging runtime and no uncanny-valley UI replicas. 

Skip also gives you complete access to platform libraries. Directly call any Swift or Objective C API on iOS, and any Kotlin or Java API on Android - no complex bridging required! 

Skip has been in development for over a year. It has an enthusiastic community of users developing a wide range of apps and continually improving Skip's ecosystem of cross-platform open source libraries.
