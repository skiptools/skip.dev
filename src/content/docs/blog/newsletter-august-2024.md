<p>Welcome to the August edition of the Skip.tools newsletter! This month we will showcase some of the improvements and advancements we've made to the Skip platform, along with some current events and a peek at our upcoming roadmap.</p>

<p><b>Skip 1.0</b></p>

<p>The big news this month was the launch of Skip 1.0! After over a year in development, Skip is finally ready for general production use. The launch has made a big splash, even being featured on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41384144">Hacker News</a>. There has never been a better time to start a new project with Skip and bring your app to the entire mobile marketplace!</p>

<p><b>New FREE Indie Pricing Tier</b></p>

<p>As part of the general availability of Skip, we are also delighted to announce the new Skip Indie tier, which enables solo developers to use Skip to build their dual-platform projects for free.</p>

<p><b>Markdown Support</b></p>

<p>On a technical front, a long-requested feature for SkipUI has been to support SwiftUI's automatic markdown support for Text elements. Well, now it's here! Styling text with simple markdown elements has never been simpler.</p>

<p><b>Reminder: Skip Showcase on the Stores</b></p>

<p>The Skip Showcase app (<a href="https://skip.tools/docs/samples/skipapp-showcase/">https://skip.tools/docs/samples/skipapp-showcase/</a>) has long been our go-to for providing a side-by-side comparison of SwiftUI components with the Jetpack Compose equivalents that SkipUI provides. Browsing thought these components simultaneously on an iPhone and Android device gives a good sense Skip's capabilities and power, and is a great way to demonstrate Skip's benefits to project managers and stakeholders before breaking ground on a new project.</p>

<p>In order to make it even easier to get this handy app on your devices, we've published the Skip Showcase app to both the Apple App Store (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skip-showcase/id6474885022">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skip-showcase/id6474885022</a>) as well as the Google Play Store (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.appfair.app.Showcase">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.appfair.app.Showcase</a>). This enables you to quickly grab a demo app that highlights Skip's power, and feel for yourself the benefit of using a genuinely native app on both platforms. Download it today and see for yourself what Skip can do!</p>

<p><b>New Skip Showreel Video</b></p>

<p>We've published a new 3-minute video summarizing Skip's capabilities. This is a great video to share with your colleagues and management to highlight some of the benefits of using Skip to bring your app to the entire matketplace. Check it out at <a href="https://skip.tools/tour/skip-showreel/">https://skip.tools/tour/skip-showreel/</a></p>
