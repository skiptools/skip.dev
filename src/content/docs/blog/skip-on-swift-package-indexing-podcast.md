I was thrilled to be interviewed by Dave and Sven from the Swift Package Indexing podcast the other day! We talked about a wide range of topics around the founding of the [Swift Android Workgroup](https://www.swift.org/android-workgroup/), the progress that Swift is making in expanding into other platforms, and how Skip builds on the Swift Android SDK to enable building both iOS and Android apps from the same SwiftUI codebase. 

We also discussed some tips for Swift package developers to make their own packages compatible with Android, and talked about the recent addition of Android compatibility to the supported platforms matrix for packages on [https://swiftpackageindex.com](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=platform%3Aios%2Candroid).

You can check out [Episode 61: "People have been working on it for ten years"](https://swiftpackageindexing.transistor.fm/episodes/61-people-have-been-working-on-it-for-ten-years) for the full transcript and show notes.

Peter and Sven are gracious hosts, and I greatly enjoyed our conversation.
