We're thrilled to announce the tech preview of Skip: dual-platform app development in Swift.

You write a modern iPhone app, and Skip transpiles it into a native Android app in real time.

Skip is the only solution that enables the creation of genuinely native apps for both iOS and Android with one language, one team, and one codebase.

Check out the [video tour](/tour) and visit the [FAQ](/docs/faq) and [documentation](/docs) to get started. Sign up at [skip.dev](/) to be notified about future updates.

Happy Skipping!
